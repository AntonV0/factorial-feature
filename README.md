# Factorial Feature
## Project #41 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This project uses test-driven developement with Mocha to build a factorial method. This was achieved by following the red-green-refactor cycle:
  - Red: write test to drive implementation (*what* you want to develop)
  - Green: write minimal implementation code (*how* to make the test pass)
  - Refactor: refactor implementation and test code (*how* to imporove the existing implementation)
## What I Learned
  - Using the Mocha test framework to test methods
  - Applying the red-green-refactor cycle to account for all edge cases
  - Setup, exercise, and verification phases
  - Using the Node.js assert module to test expressions
